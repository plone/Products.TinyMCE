Minifying
---------

We have a combined and slightly modified `tiny_mce_src.js` file inside
`Products/TinyMCE/skins/tinymce`. If someone makes changes to this file,
we need to regenerate the minified version used in production (`tiny_mce.js`).
We use the same approach TinyMCE uses itself to generate a minified version.

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

If you are on a Mac, install `apache-ant` from macports. Otherwise:

- Install the Java JDK or JRE packages
- Install Apache Ant
- Add Apache Ant to your systems path environment variable. This is not
  required but makes it easier to issue commands to Ant without having to type
  the full path for it.

Run it
++++++

In the top level directory of the distribution (this directory), run::

  ant build

That's it. The build.xml file describes the individual steps and is pretty
readable.

Check in the changes and cut a normal Python release.
