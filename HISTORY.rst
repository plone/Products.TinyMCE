  context.
  [rpatterson]

- Remove "Fancy grid listing" and "Fancy vertical listing" table

------------------

  [tom_gross]

  [tom_gross]

1.3b7 (2012-10-29)
------------------

- If the context isn't IFolderish, then the parent really should be,
  since it's got the context in it.
  [lentinj]

- Check if the context is IFolderish even when checkCreationFlag isn't
  available, i.e. when it's a Dexterity content type
  [lentinj]


1.3b6 (2012-10-16)
------------------

- Simplify how TinyMCE's javascript is included. It is now always served
  at the portal root for improved cacheability. This also fixes some
  regressions where TinyMCE was not getting initialized for some fields.
  [davisagli]

- Take context into account so breadcrumbs work e.g. for internal links and
  images [huubbouma]

- Don't break when running portal_setup > import on non-English sites having international

- Added support for Archetypes widget specific configuration overrides [miohtama]

1.3b5 (2012-09-28)
------------------

- Determine whether to include WYSIWYG-support based on a check
  on the form widgets, in the case of z3c.form. Previously, we
  would have a special case for a Dexterity-based context, looking
  up form fields based on the FTI. This should be unnecessary
  because the parent (i.e. the form) already has its widgets set
  up and this is a much more robust check.
  [malthe]

- PEP8 and pyflakes cleanup of Upload.py.
  [pjstevns]

- Prevent acquisition in setDescription.
  [pjstevns]

  [davisagli]

- Fix original scale (dexterity-based images need 'my_image/@@images/image'
  instead of just 'my_image')
  [pbauer]

- Allow upload of dexterity based images. This is aimed at
  plone.app.contentypes but should work with all dexterity bases-images.
  [pbauer]

- Set visual editor writing direction based on current language, not site
  preference. This closes ticket #10039.
  [iElectric]

- Use getToolByName instead of getUtility for portal_tinymce.
  Seems like getUtility will strip request object from context
  when doing acqusition chain.
  [iElectric]

  #12322
  [iElectric]

- Added "Edit with visual editor" button
  [iElectric]

  engine that enables you to specify exacly what it should produce
  when the user clicks the bold button.

  selected as an image type in TinyMCE settings.
  [thomasdesvenain]

1.2.7 (2011-07-05)
------------------

  wysiwyg editor.

1.2.0 (2011-01-04)
------------------

  parity with how captions were handled by kupu, and avoids misusing the alt
  text.
  [davisagli]

  the link-by-uid setting changed since the image was added. This fixes

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10792.
  [dariog, davisagli]

- Protect the control panel using the "Plone Site Setup: TinyMCE" permission,
  instead of the generic "Manage portal". Also, add the Site Administrator
  role to the default roles for this permission, for forward compatibility with
  Plone 4.1.
  [davisagli]

- Add tinymce-jsonconfiguration browser view and use it in the template
  tinymce_wysiwyg_support.pt. Make it easier to customize

  [Plone translators]

  attribute of the image tag then) we want to keep that one as image caption.
  Added check for `alt` attribute in Products.TinyMCE.transforms.parser.
  [hpeteragitator]

- In Products.TinyMCE.transforms.parser, added `full_path = unquote(full_path)`
  to remove any encoded characters from path before doing the catalog query.

  current user has an editor preference that is no longer installed.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10753
