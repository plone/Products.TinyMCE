1.1rc3 (unreleased)
-------------------

- Modified the image drawer to retrieve the actual image scales for the image
  object selected.
  The ALT text box is pre-populated with the image description or if that's empty
  then the image title.
  The upload / image details panels now toggle depending on the action you're
  performing.

- Fixed AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'
  when reinstalling TinyMCE from 1.1rc1 to 1.1rc2: adding the
  customplugins attribute fails as this attribute is not there yet
  (isn't it ironic...).  I cannot reproduce the error in a fresh site,
  but I have seen it in the wild.
