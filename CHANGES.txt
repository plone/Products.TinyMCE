  [sunew]

-------------------

- Fix original scale (dexterity-based images need 'my_image/@@images/image' 
  instead of just 'my_image')
  [pbauer]

- Allow upload of dexterity based images. This is aimed at
  plone.app.contentypes but should work with all dexterity bases-images.
  [pbauer] 

- Fixed AttributeError: ``NoneType`` object has no attribute
  ``physicalPathToURL`` when getRequest cannot get a request.  Use the
  REQUEST from the context in that case.
  [maurits]

- Determine mimetype correctly for plone.app.textfield RichText widgets with
  ignoreContext = True (such as on add forms).
  (Requires plone.app.textfield >= 1.1.1)
  [davisagli]

- Removed comma at the end of a dict in tiny_mce_init.js. This fixes javascript
  error on IE7. This was broken in 1.2.10.
  [vincentfretin]


1.2.10 (2012-01-29)
-------------------

- Fixed AttributeError: 'ATDocumentFieldsView' object has no attribute
  'absolute_url' when using inline editing.  Inline editing then still
  does not work though (checked on Plone 4.2 dev).
  [maurits]

- Fixed a few test failures in combination with five.pt.
  [maurits]

- Do not fail with an AttributeError when the member has no

  [rochecompaan]

- Updated Spanish translation
  [hvelarde]


1.2.9 (2011-11-24)

  when viewing.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11430
  [maurits]

- Add value attributes to Insert and Cancel input tags for the ploneimage popup
  template.  When Chameleon is installed attributes that don't already exist on
  a tag don't get translated.
  [swampmonkey]

  [thomasdesvenain]

  are generated correctly.
  [davisagli]

- Support RichTextValues from plone.app.textfield when determining the mimetype
  of the field being edited.
  [davisagli]

- When user tries to upload an image,
  if image type in content types registry is not allowed in current folder,
  TinyMCE tries to add an image of an other content type
  selected as an image type in TinyMCE settings.
  [thomasdesvenain]

1.2.7 (2011-07-05)
------------------

- Internationalized js messages.

  plone.uuid compatibility.
  [elro]

- Internationalization fixes.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Allows to use tinymce wysiwyg support outside of an Archetypes context.
  (Checks 'force_wysiwyg' variable value to check if wysiwyg support is enabled.)
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Don't acquire when determining the mimetype of the field being edited.
  [davisagli]

- Fixed bug when rendering for anonymous users.
  [elro]

  [jaroel]

- Fixed #11597 TinyMCE Right Pane Depends on Center Pane.
  [Brainix]


1.2.3 (2011-02-24)
------------------

- Suppress the WYSIWYG editor for fields whose text format is not HTML, and
  provide a "Edit without visual editor" link like kupu did so that the format
  can be switched from HTML to something else.
  [davisagli]

- Fix wysiwyg_support to correctly respect a user's preference to use no
  wysiwyg editor.
  [davisagli]

- Correctly load image dialog for existing images using the @@images view for
  image scales.
  [davisagli]

- Updated Norwegian translations.
  [mj]

1.2.2 (2011-02-10)
------------------

- Use @@images view for image scales.
  [elro]

- Get anchor names from listAnchorNames method of @@content_anchors.
  [elro]

  with latest zopes. (This makes the image dialogue incompatible with IE6.)
  [elro]

  [elro]

- Make setDescription convert to unicode.
  [elro]

1.2.1 (2011-02-10)

  in Zopeland folks.
  [elro]

- Do not crash when getting a configuration with styles that have an
  empty line at the end.
  [maurits]

- Handle Missing.Value for uid in JSONFolderListing.
  [elro]

- Set text/css content type on tinymce-getstyle.
  [elro]

  on the content or the portals default language.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10039
  [csenger]

- Make the spellchecker to be used configurable via the control panel utility.
  [jcbrand]

- Added the 'After the deadline' spelling and grammar checker plugin.
  [jcbrand]

1.2.0 (2011-01-04)
------------------

- Always use an image's description as its caption, and make the image dialog
  edit the description field instead of the image's alt text. This provides
  parity with how captions were handled by kupu, and avoids misusing the alt
  text.
  [davisagli]

- When editing an image, correctly highlight it in the image dialog even if
  the link-by-uid setting changed since the image was added. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10970.
  [davisagli]

- Remove the resolveuid Python script; a browser view with the same name in
  plone.outputfilters is now used instead to resolve UUIDs.
  [davisagli]

- Deprecated various helpers in plone.outputfilters.setuphandlers since they
  now duplicate functions in plone.outputfilters.
  [davisagli]

- Use the resolveuid and captioning transforms from plone.outputfilters
  instead of implementing our own. See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9938
  for details.
  [davisagli]

1.1.7 (unreleased)
------------------

- Make sure that tinymce-jsonconfiguration is traversed as a view in
  tinymce_wysiwyg_support.pt.
  [davisagli]

------------------

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10792.
  [dariog, davisagli]

- Protect the control panel using the "Plone Site Setup: TinyMCE" permission,
  instead of the generic "Manage portal". Also, add the Site Administrator
  role to the default roles for this permission, for forward compatibility with
  Plone 4.1.
  [davisagli]

- Add tinymce-jsonconfiguration browser view and use it in the template
  tinymce_wysiwyg_support.pt. Make it easier to customize
  [toutpt]

------------------

- Updated translations (de)
  [Plone translators]

- Make sure we fail gracefully on unfound UIDs when kupu isn't installed.
  [jbaldivieso]

  [Plone translators]

  [jaroel]

  [davisagli]

1.1 (2010-07-23)

  attribute of the image tag then) we want to keep that one as image caption.
  Added check for `alt` attribute in Products.TinyMCE.transforms.parser.
  [hpeteragitator]

- In Products.TinyMCE.transforms.parser, added `full_path = unquote(full_path)`
  to remove any encoded characters from path before doing the catalog query.
  [hpeteragitator]

  current user has an editor preference that is no longer installed.
