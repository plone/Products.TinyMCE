- Support RichTextValues from plone.app.textfield when determining the mimetype
  of the field being edited.
  [davisagli]

- When user tries to upload an image,
  if image type in content types registry is not allowed in current folder,
  TinyMCE tries to add an image of an other content type
  selected as an image type in TinyMCE settings.
  [thomasdesvenain]

1.2.7 (2011-07-05)
------------------

- Internationalized js messages.

  [hannosch]

  Fixes https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11632
  [WouterVH]


1.2.4 (2011-03-22)
------------------

- Use uuidFor(obj) from plone.outputfilters instead of obj.UID() for
  plone.uuid compatibility.
  [elro]

- Internationalization fixes.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Allows to use tinymce wysiwyg support outside of an Archetypes context.
  (Checks 'force_wysiwyg' variable value to check if wysiwyg support is enabled.)
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Don't acquire when determining the mimetype of the field being edited.
  [davisagli]

- Fixed bug when rendering for anonymous users.
  [elro]

  [jaroel]

  [Brainix]


1.2.3 (2011-02-24)
------------------

- Suppress the WYSIWYG editor for fields whose text format is not HTML, and
  provide a "Edit without visual editor" link like kupu did so that the format
  can be switched from HTML to something else.
  [davisagli]

- Fix wysiwyg_support to correctly respect a user's preference to use no
  wysiwyg editor.
  [davisagli]

- Correctly load image dialog for existing images using the @@images view for
  image scales.
  [davisagli]

- Updated Norwegian translations.
  [mj]

1.2.2 (2011-02-10)
------------------

- Use @@images view for image scales.
  [elro]

- Get anchor names from listAnchorNames method of @@content_anchors.
  [elro]

- Tweak ploneimage.js to use post data for setDescription for compatibility
  with latest zopes. (This makes the image dialogue incompatible with IE6.)
  [elro]

- Fix quoting of description ploneimage.js
  [elro]

- Make setDescription convert to unicode.
  [elro]

1.2.1 (2011-02-10)
------------------

  in Zopeland folks.
  [elro]

- Do not crash when getting a configuration with styles that have an
  empty line at the end.
  [maurits]

- Handle Missing.Value for uid in JSONFolderListing.
  [elro]

  [jcbrand]

1.2.0 (2011-01-04)
------------------

- Always use an image's description as its caption, and make the image dialog
  edit the description field instead of the image's alt text. This provides
  parity with how captions were handled by kupu, and avoids misusing the alt
  text.
  [davisagli]

- When editing an image, correctly highlight it in the image dialog even if
  the link-by-uid setting changed since the image was added. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10970.
  [davisagli]

- Remove the resolveuid Python script; a browser view with the same name in
  plone.outputfilters is now used instead to resolve UUIDs.
  [davisagli]

- Deprecated various helpers in plone.outputfilters.setuphandlers since they
  now duplicate functions in plone.outputfilters.
  [davisagli]

- Use the resolveuid and captioning transforms from plone.outputfilters
  instead of implementing our own. See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9938
  for details.
  [davisagli]

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10792.
  [dariog, davisagli]

- Protect the control panel using the "Plone Site Setup: TinyMCE" permission,
  instead of the generic "Manage portal". Also, add the Site Administrator
  role to the default roles for this permission, for forward compatibility with
  Plone 4.1.
  [davisagli]

- Add tinymce-jsonconfiguration browser view and use it in the template
  tinymce_wysiwyg_support.pt. Make it easier to customize
  [toutpt]

------------------

- Updated translations (de)
  [Plone translators]

- Make sure we fail gracefully on unfound UIDs when kupu isn't installed.
  [jbaldivieso]

  triggered a call to add_editor right before calling remove_editor.
  [maurits]

1.1.4 (2010-09-28)

  [jaroel]

1.1 (2010-07-23)

  attribute of the image tag then) we want to keep that one as image caption.
  Added check for `alt` attribute in Products.TinyMCE.transforms.parser.
  [hpeteragitator]

- In Products.TinyMCE.transforms.parser, added `full_path = unquote(full_path)`
  to remove any encoded characters from path before doing the catalog query.
  [hpeteragitator]
