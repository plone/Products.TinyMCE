Developing TinyMCE
==================

First start
-----------

Before you start, `http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/ <set up your git>`_.

Then fork both https://github.com/iElectric/Products.TinyMCE and
https://github.com/iElectric/Products.TinyMCE. Continue with cloning your fork
of ``Products.TinyMCE`` to your local machine::

    $ git clone git@github.com:<your_git_username>/Products.TinyMCE.git
    $ cd Products.TinyMCE

Now you need to tell buildout to use your fork of ``tinymce``. Do that by
opening up ``buildout.cfg`` with your favorite editor and changing the
``tinymce = ...`` line in ``[sources]`` section so it points to your fork::

    - tinymce = git https://github.com/iElectric/tinymce.git egg=false branch=3.4.7-plone
    + tinymce = git https://github.com/<your_git_username>/tinymce.git egg=false branch=3.4.7-plone

Cool, you are now ready to build your development environment::

    $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout

What follows is going into src/tinymce, running some scripts to build TinyMCE
and copy them in place where Plone can use them. Luckily, these steps are all
covered for by a convenience script - ``upgrade_tinymce.sh`` - which you
just need to run::

    $ ./upgrade_tinymce.sh

Ok, ready to start Zope and apply upgrade steps to your site. Once started go to
http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_setup/manage_upgrades and choose
``Products.TinyMCE:TinyMCE`` as a profile. If upgrades are available, run them.
If you see ``No upgrade avaiable`` you don't need to run anything.

After each change
-----------------

If you change something you need to rerun the tinymce builder script and
restart Plone

    $ ./upgrade_tinymce.sh
    $ bin/instance fg

Debug build
-------------

You can have unobfuscated TinyMCE available for your Plone for debugging in two ways 

* Separate files: TinyMCE uses internal script loader 

* Merged as tiny_mce_full.js

The former is recommended.

Development build
=========================

All TinyMCE source code modules are separate in the orignal tree and must be copied for to *skins* structure::

        cd src/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce
        cp -r * ../../../../Products/TinyMCE/skins/tinymce 
        
In *portal_javascripts* change *tiny_mce.js* -> *tiny_mce_dev.js*. 

Fix definitionlist: in *skins/tinymce/plugins/definitionlist* copy *editor_plug.js* as *editor_plugin_src.js*.
Don't know why this thing is broken or what's the proper fix or why Sky is blue.

Uncompressed jQuery adapter must be manually installed too.
From *skins/classes/adapter/jquery* copy *adapter.js* as *skins/jquery.tinymce.js*. 
        
Full concatenated build
=========================

Edit ``upgrade_tinymce.sh`` to do a full build::

        ant -s $tinymce_git_root/build.xml build_full
        
This will create *skins/tinymce/tiny_mce_full.js*.

Copy in jquery.tinymce.js (where?)        
        
More info about TinyMCE build process:

* https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce        

TinyMCE forked from the master repo for Plone

* https://github.com/collective/tinymce 

Updating translations
---------------------

We use two domains of translations:

 * tinymce.po files which contain TinyMCE core translations and which are only
   updated when we upgrade to a new version of TinyMCE (see below) - no touchy!
 * plone.tinymce.po files which contain translations for our custom code: if you
   change some of our templates or control panels, make sure you rebuild our
   plone.tinymce.pot file and re-sync all language files::

       $ cd Products/TinyMCE/locales
       $ i18ndude rebuild-pot --pot plone.tinymce.pot --merge plone.tinymce-manual.pot --create plone.tinymce ../
       $ i18ndude sync --pot plone.tinymce.pot ./*/LC_MESSAGES/plone.tinymce.po


Common pitfalls
---------------

If your TinyMCE is not working as excpected or is not displayed at all,
first check you haven't fallen in one of the following pits.

Building TinyMCE failed
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Maybe the ``upgrade_tinymce.sh`` script failed halfway through its
process. Stop Zope and rerun the script until you see an output like this::

    ...
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Total time: 4 seconds
    *** Cleaning old tinymce version ...
    *** Copying files ...
    *** Removing unneeded files ...
    *** Removing unneeded plugins ...
    *** Removing unneeded skins ...
    *** Updating language files ...
    *** Translations already there, copy them over ***

Use correct tinymce branch
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Go to ``src/tinymce/`` and make sure you are using the latest plone branch
of TinyMCE. The output should look something like this, with ``*`` indicating
which branch you are on::

    $ git branch
    * 3.4.3-plone
      master

/Products.TinyMCE/tinymce_language_pack/langs/: No such file or directory
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This happens sometimes when running ``./upgrade_tinymce.sh``. Remove the ``xml``
folder in utils and re-run the script::

    $ rm -rf Products/TinyMCE/utils/xml
    $ ./upgrade_tinymce.sh


Getting a new upstream version
===============================

Let's say current version in Products.TinyMCE is 3.4.3 and upstream is 3.4.7::

    $ cd src/tinymce
    $ git checkout 3.4.3
    $ git checkout -b 3.4.7
    $ git rebase --ignore-whitespace --onto 3.4.7-plone 3.4.3 3.4.7

Ignore whitespace makes sure different lineendings are not an issue while merging.

PS: It is highly recommended to use meld for merging::

    $ git config --global merge.tool meld

Set new branch in buildout
--------------------------

Open up ``buildout.cfg`` and fix the ``tinymce`` directive in ``[sources]``
section to use the new plone branch of tinymce.

Update language files for TinyMCE core
--------------------------------------

Whenever we upgrade to a new version of TinyMCE, we also need to fetch
the latest language files for TinyMCE core and convert them to .po files,
that Plone can use. You do that by using the scripts in
``Products/TinyMCE/utils``::

    # download XML language files
    $ cd Products/TinyMCE/utils
    $ python wget-xml.py

    # convert downloaded xml files into .po files
    $ python generate-po.py

    # compile .mo files out of .po files
    $ python compile-po.py

    # create tinymce.pot which is needed for pobuddy.py support
    $ cp ../locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/tinymce.po ../locales/tinymce.pot


Releasing TinyMCE
=================

* run ./upgrade_tinymce.sh
* commit all changes in skins directory with message like "sync with tinymce at revision x"
* increment version in setup.py
* run python setup.py sdist



Known local fixes which need to be merged
=========================================

- fixes in skins/tinymce/tiny_mce_src.js
- fixes in skins/tinymce/plugins/paste/pastetext.html.pt and
  skins/tinymce/plugins/paste/js/pastetext.js
- others?


Javascript coding standards
===========================

- use jslint, if you don't have it integrated with editor yet, use http://www.jslint.com/

Prerequisites
=============

If you are on a Mac, install `apache-ant` from macports. Otherwise:

- Install the Java JDK or JRE packages
- Install Apache Ant
- Add Apache Ant to your systems path environment variable. This is not
  required but makes it easier to issue commands to Ant without having to type
  the full path for it.
